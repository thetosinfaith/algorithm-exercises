# Write a function called student age. This function asks a student
# to enter their name and then it returns their age.

# For example, if a user enters precious as their name, your function
# should return, "Hi precious, you're 27 years old. This function reads data
# from the database.(Dictionary Below)

# If your name is not in the dictionary , yiur code should tel the user that their name
# is not in the dictionary, and ask them for their age.

# Your ode should then add the name and age to the dictionary of student_age below. Once added
# your code should return to the user "Hi", (added name), you're are (added age) years old."

# Remember to convert the input from user to lowercase letters
